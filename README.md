# ConnectART

Connectart is a social media web application designed to connect CESAR School's students through their taste in art, such as movies, books, music and TV shows.

With the COVID 19 pandemics, students were forced to migrate to online classes. As well as moving away from the physical teaching environment, they also moved away from social interaction. 
ConnectART grew out of a need for students to connect with each other, matching their common interests.
